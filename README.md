# Probability and Statistics Programs

# Overview

Welcome to the Probability and Statistics Programs repository! This collection of Python programs is designed to showcase various concepts and applications in Probability and Statistics. Whether you're a student looking to reinforce your knowledge or a data enthusiast exploring statistical analysis, this repository has something for you.

Each program is implemented in Python and accompanied by detailed explanations and examples to help you understand the underlying concepts. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for a given dataset.
- Generate histograms, box plots, and other visualizations to understand data distribution.

### 2. Probability Distributions
- Implement common probability distributions like the binomial, normal, Poisson, and more.
- Visualize probability distributions and compute related probabilities.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
- Perform hypothesis tests such as t-tests and chi-square tests to make data-driven decisions.
- Understand p-values, confidence intervals, and their significance in statistical analysis.

### 4. Regression Analysis
- Explore linear and multiple regression to model relationships between variables.
- Evaluate regression models and interpret regression coefficients.


## How to Use
Each program is contained within a separate directory and includes a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and a Python script (.py) for easy accessibility. You can either run the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab or download the Python scripts to run them locally on your machine.
